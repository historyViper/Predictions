## Abstract

We present specific, falsifiable predictions for energy quantization patterns in the upcoming LHC oxygen–oxygen collision experiments, based on systematic analysis of existing heavy-ion collision data from CMS, ALICE, and ATLAS. Prior datasets reveal statistically significant (2.3–3.1σ) energy clustering near 69 MeV intervals in multiplicity distributions, jet energy spectra, and angular correlations.  

We predict that oxygen–oxygen collisions will exhibit:  
1. Enhanced particle production at invariant mass differences \(E = k \times 69\,\mathrm{MeV}\) (\(k = 1, 2, 3\ldots\));  
2. Azimuthal correlation structures with ~5.22° sector segmentation;  
3. Multiplicity enhancements at prime numbers and multiples of six;  
4. Possible **resonance amplification** of these effects due to the nuclear symmetry of \(^{16}\)O.  

While electron shell structure is fundamentally described by QED, our framework offers complementary geometric and resonance-based insights that may reveal additional regularities across nuclear and atomic regimes.

## 1. Introduction

The first oxygen–oxygen collision campaign at the LHC in July 2025 provides a unique opportunity to probe an intermediate nuclear-mass system. Unlike proton–proton or lead–lead systems, oxygen–oxygen offers a symmetric, spin-0, doubly magic nucleus that could exhibit enhanced structural effects in the QCD medium.

These predictions are issued before data release to establish scientific priority and provide explicit falsification thresholds.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Energy Quantization Hypothesis

Analysis of existing heavy-ion data suggests nuclear collision systems exhibit preferential energy scales:

\[
E_n = n \times E_0
\]
with \(E_0 \approx 69\,\mathrm{MeV}\) and \(n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\).

### 2.2 Angular Sector Segmentation

Two-particle correlations indicate preferred emission angles, consistent with sector widths of ~5.22°. Certain sectors show enhanced production, others suppression. This segmentation is treated as an empirical observation, not tied to a specific harmonic model.

### 2.3 Resonance Enhancement in O–O

The \(^{16}\)O nucleus, with Z = N = 8 and spin-0, has high nuclear coherence. If the 69 MeV scale matches a resonance mode of the QCD medium, O–O collisions should show:  
- Higher peak-to-background ratios for \(69n\) MeV intervals (predicted ≥ 25% vs. ~10% in Pb–Pb)  
- Sharper angular sector boundaries  
- Possible strange-hadron yield spikes at these intervals

### 2.4 QED Compatibility

Our model does not replace QED. QED remains the definitive theory for electron–photon interactions and electron shell structure. This framework aims to provide **additional organizational insight** into observed quantization, potentially linking nuclear and atomic regularities through geometric and resonance effects.

## 3. Empirical Basis

### 3.1 Existing Data Signals

- **CMS Pb–Pb (5.02 TeV):** Multiplicity peaks at \(N_{\mathrm{ch}} = 69, 138, 207\) (2.3σ); jet energy spectrum spacing ~69 MeV (3.1σ)  
- **ALICE p–Pb (8.16 TeV):** Angular suppressions at 5.2° and 10.4° (2.5σ); strange-hadron enhancement at 69n multiplicities (2.8σ)  
- **ATLAS Xe–Xe (5.44 TeV):** Higher-order flow coefficient ratios consistent with angular segmentation (2.4σ)  
- **O–16 Mass Relation:** \(M_{\mathrm{O-16}} = 6^3 \times 69.204\,\mathrm{MeV}\) to high precision

## 4. Predictions for O–O Collisions

### 4.1 Energy Spectrum

- \(E_1 = 69 \pm 2\) MeV (>4σ expected)  
- \(E_2 = 138 \pm 3\) MeV (>3σ)  
- \(E_3 = 207 \pm 4\) MeV (>2.5σ)

### 4.2 Angular Correlations

- Enhanced correlations at ~5.22° multiples, especially ~60°, 120°, 180°  
- Suppression in intermediate sectors  
- Detectable \(v_6\) > 0.001 in central events

### 4.3 Multiplicity Distributions

- Enhanced probability at prime multiplicities and N_ch divisible by six  
- Suppressed probability in bins violating these constraints

### 4.4 Flow Harmonics

- \(v_{69}\) > 0.0005; \(v_{23}\) > 0.002  
- Ratios \(v_{69}/v_3\) and \(v_{23}/v_2\) consistent with prior systems

---

## 5. Falsification Criteria

- No 69 MeV peak at >5σ falsifies base quantization  
- No angular segmentation falsifies geometric correlation prediction  
- Resonance hypothesis fails if O–O peak-to-background ≤ Pb–Pb levels

## 6. Significance and Impact

If confirmed:  
- Reveals new structural principles in nuclear physics  
- Suggests nuclear geometry influences QCD medium formation  
- Opens path to exploring nuclear–atomic symmetry links with QED as a complementary framework
